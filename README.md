# Machine Learning
 This is repository for Machine Learning by using scikit learn in python.

## Desciption
<pre>
    Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI. In this repository, you I put what I learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing me and getting me to work for myself. More importantly, I learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, I learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.
     In this repository, I put a broad introudction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Something like unsupervised learning and lots of algorithm specifically about regrssion.

####I put most of things for imporving my knowledege not for teaching knowledge to somebody that's what this repository is all about.
